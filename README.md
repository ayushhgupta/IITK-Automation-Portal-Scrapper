# IITK-Automation-Portal-Scrapper

In this project, I learnt about the Python library, BeautifulSoup, and used it to scrape the data of the faculty available on the IIT Kanpur Automation Portal, https://iitk.ac.in/new/iitk-faculty.

I organised the data in a Dataframe and stored it in CSV format using Pandas library.
